## 🚨 AI Security & Governance 

### **AI Security Governance Framework**
https://github.com/qexa/AI-Security-Governance-Framework  

An enterprise-grade, Security-as-Code framework for securing RAG-based AI systems end to end.  
This project demonstrates how to operationalize AI security using threat modeling, CI/CD enforcement, adversarial testing, and runtime guardrails with an evidence-first approach aligned to NIST AI RMF and OWASP LLM risks.

**Focus areas:**  
• AI threat modeling (STRIDE for RAG & agents)  
• CI/CD policy gates and drift detection  
• Adversarial testing and red-teaming  
• Runtime hallucination and PII guardrails  
• Audit-ready evidence generation
